# Styling Sliders

 - There are great libraries to help implement sliders:
  - [Flexslider](https://woocommerce.com/flexslider/)

## Flexslider

We add Flexslider with yarn to our project. We will have installed the needed files at

```
node_modules/flexslider/
node_modules/jquery/
```

Now we add the flexslider script to our index.html file
